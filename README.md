> What's pOneWheel?

Looking for extended and hidden stats for your fancy new OneWheel? And what about logging of these stats to figure out where exactly did things go wrong and cause you to eat asphalt? This app does log all these stats and also shows footpads that are activated, lifetime miles on your OneWheel, trip top speed, and more. Additionally this app includes power settings like setting the OneWheel LED front/back lights and brightness, triggering vibrations based on battery levels, and ability to change the ride mode at any time.

> What's the plan?

We plan to get a new release with all the new features, bug fixes, etc on the Google Play store soon. There have been a good amount of changes and as soon as we get a stable release workflow and sign off on it, it will be posted. From there on the plan is to do continuous releases.
